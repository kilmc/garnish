# Garnish

Garnish for your Sassy CSS cocktails. Made to be used on top of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io).

## Usage

1. [Download as zip](https://github.com/paulozoom/garnish/archive/master.zip). (Bower coming soon)
2. Include Garnish in your code with `@include "src/garnish"`

## Development

### Rules

- Including Garnish should create no output. All code should be mixins and functions.
- Garnish code should make no style decisions or assumptions. Defaults are OK.
- Although using Bourbon is encouraged, Garnish should be library-agnostic.

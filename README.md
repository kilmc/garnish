# Garnish

Garnish for your Sassy CSS cocktails. Made to be used on top of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io).

## Rules:

- Including Garnish should create no output. All code should be mixins and functions.
- Garnish code should make no style decisions or assumptions. Defaults are OK.
- Although using Bourbon is encouraged, Garnish should be library-agnostic.
